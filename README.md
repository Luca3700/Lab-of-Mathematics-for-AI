### Repository for the files used for the exam of Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Artificial Intelligence

1. In the homework number 1 there are some exercises about the relation between the condition number of a matrix and the ill-conditioning.
2. The homework number two is divided in two part
- in the first one there are exercises on PCA and LDA,
- in the second one there are excercises on the singular value decomposition.
3. The homework number three is divide in two major part
- the first one is composed by the file `homework3_GD` that contains exercises on gradient descent
- the second one is composed by:
  * the file `homework3_SGD`, where there is an exercise on using the stochastic gradient descent method to learn a model to predict the label of a digit of the mnist dataset (it is done using only two digits)
  * the file `homework3_PCA_LDA`, where are compared the result of the SGD w.r.t. the result obtained by the PCA and the LDAÃ¹
4. In the homework four there are some exercises on regression using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
